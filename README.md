# Commands for creating the MySQL database:


First we have to open the MySQL shell, for for macOS use `mysql -u root -p`

Once we are inside **MySQL Shell**, we create the database:

    create database swtDatabase;

Then we create the user:

    create user 'manager'@'%'
    identified by '0123456789';

Then we grant the user all the privileges:

    grant all on swtDatabase.* to 'manager'@'%';
